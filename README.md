# Linear Regression Models for Time Series Data

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of linear regression models to time series data, specifically on stock market data (S&P 500). The notebook walks through the steps of preprocessing the data, fitting a linear regression model, and visualizing the results, including trends and uncertainty (standard deviations).

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and processed for use in linear regression modeling.
- **Modeling**: Linear regression models are applied to identify trends in the time series data.
- **Visualization**: The notebook provides visual representations of the actual stock prices, predicted trends, and standard deviations to assess model performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install the required packages using the following command:
bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

### Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   bash
   git clone <repository-url>

Open the notebook in Jupyter:
jupyter notebook Linear\ Regression\ Models.ipynb

Run the cells to preprocess the data, train the linear regression model, and visualize the results.

Results
The model provides a clear representation of the trend in the stock market data, along with upper and lower bounds representing one standard deviation from the predicted trend.
A red dashed line is used to depict the trend, and green dashed lines are used to represent the confidence intervals (Â±1 standard deviation).
